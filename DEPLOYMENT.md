# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Required Environment Variables

To deploy the WhatsApp Dashboard to Vercel successfully, you need to set these environment variables:

### 1. JWT_SECRET (Required for Production)
```
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-here
```
**Example**: `JWT_SECRET=sk-proj-abc123xyz789very-long-random-string-here`

**Important**: Generate a strong, random 32+ character secret. You can use:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. ADMIN_PASSWORD (Required)
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
```
This is the password used to access the admin panel.

### 3. BACKEND_URL (Optional)
```
BACKEND_URL=http://tramway.proxy.rlwy.net:12332
```
This defaults to the Railway backend URL, but you can change it if your backend is hosted elsewhere.

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to set them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Deployment Commands

The application is already configured for Vercel deployment with:
- Production-ready HTTPS cookies
- Secure JWT authentication
- Proper CORS configuration
- Error handling for production environment

## Troubleshooting

### Sessions Not Loading
- Verify `BACKEND_URL` is correct and accessible
- Check if the backend service is running
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

### Admin Login Errors
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set (required for production)
- Check `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is correct
- Ensure cookies are being set (check browser dev tools)

### Authentication Issues
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)
- Check that cookies are being sent with requests
- Verify JWT_SECRET is the same across all instances

## Automatic Features

The application automatically detects Vercel environment and:
- Enables secure HTTPS cookies
- Uses production JWT secret
- Applies stricter CORS policies
- Handles errors gracefully
